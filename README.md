Game Jam 2018

My team and I made this bounce platform game in an hour in the University of Bristol Computer Science Society Game Jam in November 2018.
We used Unity with basic C# to make the game.

The game contains 4 levels, each with increasing difficulty. Falling on certain obstacles causes the level to restart. 
Landing on certain platforms may lead to danger, so beware!

The game works on macOS. Download the repository and double-click on the "Game Impossible" file to play.

Have fun!
